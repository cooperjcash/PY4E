# PY4E
This is my collection of the PY4E course examples that I completed on my own while learning how to code in python.

All of my examples are located within the folders labeled with the conventions ex_'chapterNumber'_'exampleNumber'
I used the examples directly from https://www.py4e.com/ but followed the https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/ curriculum
most of my code is commented in blocks describing what it does

Enjoy!
